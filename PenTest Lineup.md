Here will be my way of work for pentesting

# Step 1 : Scanning
Scan the target when i say scan it mean scan everything, it can be network scanning or web scanning if a web port is open, scan every thing a NOTE !
## Step 1 : Network scanning
Use [[NMAP]] to scan the target, my prefered command is : `nmap -v -sC -sV -Pn -oN ./first <target>`
-v = verbose
-sC = script safe
-Pn = consider host up
-oN = store the scan in a file
## Step 1 : Dir webapp scanning
use [[GoBuster]] to scan the target web dir, my prefered command is : `gobuster -u <targer_ip> -w <wordlist_file> dir` (maybe look for dirsearch/dirbuster)
## Step 1 : Scan the linux machine
Use [[Enum4linux]] to scan the target linux machine to know many infos such as users, groups, version etc..

# Step 2 : Analysis

This step consists in an analyse of the scans and basic osint for finding some vulns & flaws.

## Step 2 : Network analyse
Note all the open port &  basically if you succed to get the version of the services that the target is using on each port, u can search for an exploit on EXPLOIT DB

## Step 2 : Web analyse
As basically as the first step, if your dir scan gived you some hidden urls, u can see what u can do with it, maybe reach them, maybe look for any expoit like XSS or SQL injections or any other OWASP vuln

---
# Step 3 : Exploit

Here is the tricky thing.

## Step 3 : Brute force
If during ur scans u got access to a username u can try to bruteforce a service, such as ssh or smb.

## Step 3 : Exploit DB
If u are not able to bruteforce cause u have any data, u can at least look at an exploit on a version of the service running, (Exploit DB)

---
# Step 4 : Privilege escalation
At this point we are connected to the target via ssh or whatever, and we want to get the privilige to do what ever we want

## Step 4 : using scripts
Use linpeas github script 
Note: u can use SCP to pass file throught machines
