Breached database search is a website, where we can find all the data from giant techs that had already leacked in the past.

*Major social media and tech giants have suffered data breaches in the past.  As a result, the leaked data is publicly available and, most of the time contains PII like usernames, email addresses, mobile numbers and even passwords. Users may use the same password across all the websites; that enables bad actors to re-use the same password against a user on a different platform for a complete account takeover. Many web services offer to check if your email address or phone number is in a leaked database; [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is one of the free services.*
